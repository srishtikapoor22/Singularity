### Singularity: Neural Network Visualizer ###
Interactive 3D neural network inspector that breaks open AI's "black box." Input XOR values or handwritten digits and watch how information flows through layers - each neuron renders as a glowing sphere with brightness matching activation strength.

# Features #
1. Real-time neural network visualization with interactive 3D interface
2. Activation mapping where neuron brightness reflects firing strength
3. Support for XOR logic problems and MNIST digit recognition
4. Educational tool for understanding deep learning concepts
5. Holographic aesthetics with sci-fi inspired dark theme
Layer-by-layer analysis of information flow
